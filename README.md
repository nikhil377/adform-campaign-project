## Info about MS teams and websockets
Microsoft Teams uses web sockets as part of its communication protocol to enable real-time messaging and collaboration between users. Web sockets provide a persistent, bi-directional communication channel between the Teams client application and the Teams server application, allowing messages and other data to be sent and received in real-time without the need for repeated HTTP requests.
When a user logs into Teams, the client application establishes a web socket connection with the Teams server, allowing for real-time communication between the user's device and the server. This enables users to send and receive messages, make calls, and share files in real-time, all within the Teams application.
